# Webdev

---

Welcome to the official repository for my web development journey! I'm Siyabonga Samson Lukhele, also known as **@markuptitan** across various platforms. I hail from the beautiful country of South Africa, and my passion for web development began in 2019, with full dedication kicking in towards the end of 2023.

## Who Am I?

I'm an enthusiastic learner, eager to collaborate on beginner-level projects and grow together with the community. Although I'm still on the learning curve, I'm excited to share my progress and projects through this GitHub repository.
