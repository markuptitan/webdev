      <h1>Who I am&quest;</h1>
      <p>
        Though I am still learning I am an enthusiast who is willing to learn
        collaboratively on simple beginner projects.My name is Siyabonga Samson
        Lukhele and on all platforms which I am in my username is
        <strong>@markuptitan</strong>. I am from South Africa and I discovered
        Web development in 2019 although I have fully invested myself near the
        end of 2023.

      <h2><u>Webdev as a repo.</u></h2>
      <p>
        As I am still learning, I will be publishing my roadmap projects, my
        current progress and opening up myself to partner learning here on
        Github. This repo is dedicated to practicing certain tasks before
        publishing finished and polished projects of a seperate repo. What this
        means is the code you'll see on most projects from this repo are
        unfinished versions and the finished versions are published on a
        separate repo.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="/forms/">Forms</a></h2>

      <p>
        This repo has a few forms I have created using HTML and I will later
        customize using CSS.
      </p>
      <ul id="form_projects">
        <li>Sign up form</li>
        <li><del>Log In form</del></li>
        <li><del>Contact form</del></li>
        <li><del>Job Application form</del></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I have not started creating the forms which I have crossed out as I am
        still starting out but as time proceeds, I shall create them.
